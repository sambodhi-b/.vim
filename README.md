# My Vim Configs

## Installation
Clone this repository to Home Directory. This will create a .vim directory in your home directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/sambodhi-b/.vim.git
```
Then the packages need to be pulled in. As they are set up as Git Submodules;
```
cd ~/.vim && git submodule update --init
```
should do the trick.
